# WARNING: It won't run without config.py!
You should add `config.py` yourself, it will include your APIKEY.
e.g: `echo "APIKEY=7dfhg7hf8dg7fdgh7fg8h7874h25jh5" >> config.py`

### Change ```classes.txt``` according to U.

Simple. Just run ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` to get dependencies, and run the main.py file with ```python3 main.py``` and add your API Key to config.py as ```APIKEY="blahblah"``` section at the code.
